// This file previously contained performCensor and readFileAsDataURI.
// performCensor is removed as video processing logic is now assumed to be handled by the FastAPI backend
// via direct API calls from the client (through VideoContext and apiClient.ts).
// readFileAsDataURI can be kept if it's generally useful, or removed if not used elsewhere.
// For now, I will remove it to keep the focus on API-driven interactions.
// If client-side file-to-dataURI conversion is needed elsewhere, it can be a utility function.

// No server actions related to video censoring are defined here anymore.
// The `logTokenOnServer` action in `src/lib/server-actions/auth-actions.ts` remains for auth debugging.

export {}; // Add an empty export to satisfy module requirements if no other exports exist.
