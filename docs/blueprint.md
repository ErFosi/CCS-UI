# **App Name**: VideoRevive

## Core Features:

- Login Page: Implement a login page with email and password fields, bypassing actual authentication but keeping the logic for future API integration.
- My Videos Display: Design and implement the 'My Videos' section to display videos as cards, showing before and after upscale versions with 'Play' and 'Download' buttons.
- Upload & Upscale: Develop the 'Upload & Upscale' section, including a button to upload videos (mp4 preferred), a video preview, and an Upscale button. Enforce that the uploaded video is 480p before upscaling.
- AI-Powered Upscaling: Provide an Upscale button functionality using AI that intelligently upscales videos from 480p to 1080p, enhancing the clarity and detail. The AI tool should decide how many enhancement operations (sharpness, denoise) it uses to create an ideal upscale result.
- Video Playback: Allow users to play the uploaded and upscaled videos directly within the app using a video player component. Enable playback controls (play/pause, volume, etc.).
- Download Videos: Enable users to download both the original and upscaled videos.
- Environment Configuration: Configure backend URL using environment variables (e.g., VITE_API_URL in .env or env.ts) for easy adjustments.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use black (#000000) for a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Background color: Implement a white background (#FFFFFF) to support the minimalist design and enhance the contrast and clarity of on-screen elements.
- Accent color: Incorporate yellow (#FFFF00) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use clear, modern typography to ensure readability.
- Implement a clean, minimalistic layout.
- Employ simple, monochrome icons
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
